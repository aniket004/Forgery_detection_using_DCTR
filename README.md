For Details refer to paper: Aniket Roy, Diangarti Tariang, Rajat Subhra Chakraborty, Ruchira Naskar: 
"Discrete Cosine Transform Residual Feature based Filtering Forgery and Splicing Detection in JPEG Images." 
CVPR Workshops 2018.

DCTR features are extracted using DCTR.m .
refer to ( V. Holub and J. Fridrich, "Low Complexity Features for JPEG Steganalysis Using Undecimated DCT", 
IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, DCTR feature : http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/feature_extractors/)

Train the classifier using SVM : using LIBSVM package.
